This project was part of the discipline of COMPILERS, in Senai Cimatec.

It follows a set of rules, determined by the teacher, to simulate a new programming language 'O#'

to run over a input text file:
```
python main.py
```
As output the code gives to files, .LEX and .TAB, with the same name as input

for test we have a 'input_test.201' file
